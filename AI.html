    <section>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Interpolation:</strong> Interpolation is a key technique in upscaling. It involves estimating values of pixels that are not present in the original content. Various algorithms, such as bicubic or bilinear interpolation, are used to calculate these intermediate pixel values.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Edge Enhancement:</strong> To improve the sharpness of the upscaled image, edge enhancement algorithms are employed. These algorithms identify edges and contours in the image and apply enhancements to make them more distinct and defined.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Detail Enhancement:</strong> Some upscaling processes incorporate detail enhancement to add missing textures and fine details to the upscaled image. This helps in preserving and even enhancing the visual quality.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Machine Learning and AI:</strong> In some advanced systems, machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) are used for upscaling. These systems are trained on large datasets to learn patterns and details, allowing them to make more intelligent decisions during the upscaling process.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Temporal Filtering:</strong> For video content, temporal filtering is used to analyze and enhance temporal details across frames. This helps in producing smoother and more natural-looking motion in the upscaled video.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Color Correction:</strong> Upscaling may also involve color correction to ensure that the colors in the upscaled image match those in the original content. This helps in maintaining a consistent and accurate color representation.</li>
          </ul>
