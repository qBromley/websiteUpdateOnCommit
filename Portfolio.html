                <h3 class = headerPort> Connect 4</h1>
                <p class = connect4> This was a project where I created a connect-4 game where the user plays against a robot. The robot has levels of priority where it will always play a winning move when it can, after that, it prioritizes blocking when the user is about to win, and it will block it. From there it will try to stack on its existing exposed pieces to get itself closer to a win. Along with the robot I programmed I created a graphical interface that is visually appealing. The program also has a reset feature and quality-of-life features such as click validation.</p>
                <h3 class = headerPort>Racing Game\ Dungeon Game</h1>
                <p class = hackathon> This was a hackathon where we had one day to create something. My team decided to work on a simple racing game. we did this in c++ and used a combination of classes functions and dynamica memory allocation to make it. We did not have a GUI so the graphical part of the prooject was done using slashes dashes and *. This was all built off a different project where the user navigated a dungeon avoiding enimies that moved tword it on every move , and the user had to look for a key and an exit to escape.</p>

                <p class = laintxt> I participated in a project focused on developing autonomous lane change algorithms using Matlab. Our group specifically concentrated on lane changing in various road conditions and emergency scenarios. For instance, we implemented the capability for the car to autonomously change lanes around obstacles such as animals. Additionally, we simulated lane changes in altered road conditions to enhance the adaptability of the autonomous system.</p>
                <h3 class = headerPort>Seam Carving</h1>
                    <p class = imagesplicing> In this project, I developed an algorithm designed to identify and remove pixels with the lowest "energy" in an image. Through this process, the algorithm selectively deleted lines of pixels, a technique known as Seam Carving. Seam Carving allows for resizing images while preserving the most meaningful parts, ensuring that no crucial details are omitted..  </p>
